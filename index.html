<h3>What</h3>
<p>Mudkip is a very opinionated markdown folder to html site generator, so
opinionated that I didn't even want to write docs for it but, since I'm a nice
human being, I'll do so.</p>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>No good reason, when do I ever have a good reason to build things.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/barelyhuman/statico">statico</a> to learn go and I'm
writing this to learn a bit of nim and might just solve my ever increasing
idiotic behavior of designing a new style for every documentation I write.</p>
<p>The only valid thought I had about writing this was that I can use the <code>docs</code>
folder in the project as an offline documentation for anyone working with the
library,package,etc while also having a web version for people to read.</p>
